# ac-library-mirror

This is a mirror of [`AtCoder Library (ACL)`](https://atcoder.jp/posts/518).
The purpose of this repository is to keep track of changes on the original library.
This may be helpful in creating wrapper in other languages as well.

## License

Since all the files under `atcoder/` direcotry in the original zip file
are published under CC0 license, 
the contents of this repository are also published under CC0 license too.
There are no declaration about other files (documentations and `expand.py`),
so those files are not included in this repository.

## Updates

If there are any changes on the original library,
I am going to update this library accordingly.
Note that if I am busy, I may not be able to do so.
In such case, feel free to make pull requests.
(If I am extremely busy then, I may not even have time to approve the request.
 in such case, please refer to fork repositories.)
